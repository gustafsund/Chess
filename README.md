# Chess

This repository is a personal side project of mine. The classes and functionalities for chess rules etc. are in the file new_classes.py (name will likely change, old chess classes were less successful). The Board class can be thought of as a game, keeping track on castling rights, legal moves, whos turn it is and if there is a winner. I have yet to implement pawn promotion, en passant and the draw by threefold repetition. The graphics-file currently only allows for moving pieces by clicking pieces and no bot player has been implemented. For when a computer bot is in place, I'd like to create the experience of playing the computer and then of course, for the graphics class this means switching the board so that black is at the bottom. 

## Goal: 
The long-term goal is to create a machine learning model to play the game of chess (also considering a minimax-bot as a first step, i.e. a more classic chess-engine).
